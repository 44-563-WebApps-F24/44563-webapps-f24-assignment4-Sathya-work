        <h1> Sathyanarayana Mallipudi presents a Greek play by Sophocles</h1>
            <h3>PHILOCTETES Sophocles</h3> 
            <b>NEO.</b><br>
            What then is thy command? To lie? No more?<br>
            <b>OD.</b><br>
            To entangle Philoctetes with deceit.<br>
            <b>NEO.</b><br>
            Why through deceit? May not persuasion fetch him?<br>
            <b>OD.</b><br>
            Never. And force as certainly will fail<br>
            <b>NEO.</b><br>  
            What lends him such assurance of defence?<br>
            <b>OD.</b><br>
            Arrows, the unerring harbingers of Death<br>
            <b>NEO.</b><br>
            Then to go near him is a perilous thing.<br>
            <b>OD.</b><br>
            Unless with subtlety, as I have said.<br>
            <b>NEO.</b><br>
            And is not lying shameful to thy soul?<br>
            <b>OD.</b><br>
            Not if by lying I can save my soul.<br>
            <b>NEO.</b><br>
            How must one look in speaking such a word?<br>
            <b>OD.</b><br>
            Where gain invites, this shrinking is not good..<br>
            <b>NEO.</b><br>
            What gain I through his coming back to Troy?<br>
            <b>OD.</b><br>
            His arms alone have power to take Troy-town.<br>
            <b>NEO.</b><br>
            Then am not I the spoiler, as ye said?<br>
            <b>OD.</b><br>
            Thou without them, they without thee, are powerless.<br>
            <b>NEO.</b><br>
            If it be so, they must be sought and won.<br>
            <b>OD.</b><br>
            Yea, for in this two prizes will be thine.<br>
